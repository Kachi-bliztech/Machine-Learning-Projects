<h1>Diabetes Prediction Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on developing a machine learning classification system to predict whether an individual is diabetic or non-diabetic based on key medical indicators. We utilize a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for its effectiveness in handling classification problems with high-dimensional data.

The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing various medical attributes (such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc.). During training, the SVM algorithm attempts to map this data in multi-dimensional space and identify the optimal hyperplane that separates the two target classesâ€”diabetic and non-diabetic.

Once trained, the model can classify new, unseen patient data by determining on which side of the hyperplane the data point falls. This enables it to accurately predict the likelihood of diabetes in a patient. The ultimate goal is to build a robust, scalable classification system that can assist in early detection and medical decision-making.
